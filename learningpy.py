print("Hello world")
#This will just print whatever is inside the quotation when you run the program.

print("Hello")
print("I am a computer")
#This, when it is run, shows that sequencing matters. It will show "hello" before "I am a computer".

#To create a variable in Python you give it a name and make it equal to a value.
#This is known as assignment. For example:

my_variable = "some useful data"

my_name = "Victoria"
print(my_name)

#When using print you put the name of the variable between the () instead of text. 
#The print instruction will retrieve the value from the my_name variable and display it.
#Then...

print("My name is" + my_name)

#input is another command
#input() uses the function input to display a prompt and capture the user’s response.
users_name = input("enter your name")
print("hello" + users_name + ", welcome")


#boolean function: Used for storing values which can only ever be true or false	True or False
#float	 = Similar to integer but for non whole (decimal) numbers  	(1.234)
#list	 = Used to store many items of data in an order e.g. a list a peoples names	["Martin", "Rik", "Hitesh"]

#Note: the double == operator means “is this equal to?” 
#Opposed to a single = which follows a variable and means “make this equal to”.

1==1 ; True

#! = is the operator for is not equal to,
# which means this statement means is 1 not equal to 2. != is the opposite of the == operator.

1 != 2
#  != is the operator for is not equal to, which means this statement means
# is 1 not equal to 2. != is the opposite of the == operator.

# you can use <= test if something is less than or equal to:

1 <=1
 #True!
